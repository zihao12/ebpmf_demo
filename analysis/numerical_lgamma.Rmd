## Introduction

The following function computes a part of negative binomial loglikelihod (allows for continuous number ...). It should be continuous w.r.t to $x$, but when $a$ is much larger than $x$, there is some numerical issue. 

```{r}
f <- function(x, a){
  return(lgamma(x + a) - lgamma(a))
}

a = 2*1e+16

xs = seq(0,50, 0.01)

plot(xs, f(xs, a))
```


```{r}
f(2, a)

f(3, a)

f(11,a)

f(20,a)

f(30,a)

f(40,a)

f(50,a)
```


Is `lgamma` continuous?

```{r}
ys = seq(1,1000,0.01)
plot(ys, lgamma(ys))


plot(ys, lgamma(1e+5 + ys))

plot(ys, lgamma(1e+10 + ys))

plot(ys, lgamma(1e+15 + ys))

plot(ys, lgamma(1e+17 + ys))

```
